    "# Working with large virtual chemical libraries: Part 3 - Thompson Sampling for Classification\n",

    "\n",
    "Only about 18 months after I wrote the first one, this is part 3 of a three post series on working with large chemical libraries. The notebook used to create this post and all the files can be found in this [github repo](https://github.com/jonswain/TS-for-classification).\n",

    "## Chemical space and combinatorial libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first two parts of this series, I've discussed how chemical space is vast. The estimates of the size of theoretical chemical space, ranging from $10^{50}$ to $10^{80}$ possible compounds, vastly exceeds our practical screening capabilities, even when constrained to commercial combinatorial libraries like Enamine REAL, which contains tens of billions of compounds. As previously mentioned, even with a fast scoring function of one second per compound, exhaustively screening a billion-compound library would take over 31 years. This fundamental limitation necessitates the use of intelligent search strategies to efficiently navigate and identify active molecules within these immense virtual spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Thompson Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "This whole series was inspired by a paper on searching ultra-large chemical spaces using Thompson Sampling by Pat Walters et al., [\"Thompson Sampling─An Efficient Method for Searching Ultralarge Synthesis on Demand Databases\"](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01790).\n",
    "\n",
    "[Thompson Sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_sampling) is a powerful reinforcement learning technique used to address the [\"multi-armed bandit problem\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit). In the multi-armed bandit problem, a gambler must choose which of a row of slot machines (multi-armed bandits) to play, aiming to maximize total returns by finding the most rewarding machine. This requires balancing exploration (testing all machines to estimate their true return rate) and exploitation (playing the machine currently believed to be the best).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thompson Sampling aims to maximize returns by modeling a **posterior belief distribution** (the probability distribution of potential rewards) for each slot machine. This is usually initially generated by random sampling to build up a distribution. During each round of Thompson Sampling, for each machine, a value is randomly sampled from its posterior belief distribution, and the machine with the highest sampled value is selected for the next trial (the arm on the slot machine is pulled). The outcome (reward) from that trial is then used to update the machine's belief distribution, making it more accurate. The randomness associated from sampling the belief distribution for each machine allows exploration of the returns for each machine, but because the machines with genuinely higher returns will have distributions that generally return higher numbers when sampled, they are trialed more frequently, allowing for sufficient exploitation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Thompson Sampling for virtual chemistry screening\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper by Walters et al., the \"slot machines\" are the individual building blocks used in a virtual reaction. These blocks are combined to form a virtual molecule, which is then assessed using a scoring function (the \"reward\"). Each building block has a belief distribution for the scores associated with compounds containing it, which is updated after the compound is scored.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors are seeking to maximize a continuous scoring function. They modeled the reward distribution using a Normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$:\n",
    "$$X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "After each trial, a Bayesian update was performed on the parameters ($\\mu$ and $\\sigma$) of the belief distribution for each building block found in the scored compound. Using this method, the authors showed that Thompson Sampling could identify more than half of the top 100 molecules from a docking-based virtual screen of 335 million molecules by evaluating just 1% of the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Thompson Sampling for classification\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we've built a classification machine learning model to predict compound activity (Active=1, Inactive=0), but we're not able to exhaustatively screen the entire library, can we use Thompson Sampling to find active compounds from our library? We can no longer model our reward distributions using the Normal distribution, as our activity labels are just 0 or 1, and we can't have values greater than 1 or less than 0. Instead we need to use the [Beta Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying event when scoring each compound is a [Bernoulli trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_trial), returning either a success (1) or a failure (0), so we can use the Bernoulli distribution to model the probability the compound containing the building block is active with probability $p$. For the Bayesian statistics required for Thompson Samping, we need to model the uncertainty about $p$. The Beta distribution is the **conjugate prior probability distribution** for the Bernoulli distribution, making it the perfect choice to model the uncertainty about $p$. The Beta distribution is a family of continuous probability distributions defined between 0 and 1, defined by two parameters: alpha ($\\alpha$) and beta ($\\beta$). Alpha is related to the number of successes (active compounds), and beta to the number of failures (inactive compounds) in the Bernoulli trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, $\\alpha$ is updated by adding 1 for a success, and $\\beta$ is updated by adding 1 for a failure. However, since a classification ML model provides a probability prediction ($P_{\\text{pred}}$), we can use a more informative soft-update approach: we sum $P_{\\text{pred}}$ for $\\alpha$ (representing partial success evidence), and sum $1 - P_{\\text{pred}}$ for $\\beta$ (representing partial failure evidence).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data and machine learning classification model\n",
    "\n",
    "As with all the other posts in this series, the smi files used here were borrowed from Pat Walters repository on [Thompson sampling](https://github.com/PatWalters/TS). These files contain three different types of building blocks, with 100 examples in each. Reacting all combinations of these building blocks creates a virtual library of one million compounds. The other dataset is a collection of chemical compounds labelled with their hERG activity from [Cai et al](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00769). This dataset is used to train a classification machine learning model to predict hERG activity. This model can then be used with Thompson Sampling to select the compounds from the virtual library with the highest predicted values for hERG activity. We generally want to minimise hERG activity, but this could be replaced with a QSAR classification model to predict on-target activity.\n",
